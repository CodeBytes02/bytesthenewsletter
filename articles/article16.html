Customer behavior plays a vital role in customer service sector to accurately predict the customer churn. 
Customer churn arises when the customer does not want to continue their relations with the company 
during certain time frame. As there is increase in competition among customer service sector, it has 
dominant to predict the Dynamic behavior of the customer. We have adapted advent of the deep learning 
paradigms namely LSTM and variants of LSTM based models to predict the churn on daily dynamic behavior 
of the customer. The predictive performance of these models evaluated on dataset collected from mobile 
operator. The results showed that the daily models significantly outperform previously developed models 
in terms of predicting churners earlier and more accurately.<br>

                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Customer churn refers to the situation where by a 
customer leaves a service provider. In simple terms, churn 
is defined as cancellation of subscription by a client to a 
service they have been using. Churn Prediction is essential 
in predicting the clients most likely to unsubscribe based 
on their usage of services like company tariffs, poor 
customer care or frequent technical issues, helping 
organizations to focus more on the customers with high 
risk of leaving.<br>

Customer churn happens when customers decide to 
not continue purchasing products/services from an 
organization and end their association. It is an integral 
parameter for the organization since acquiring a new 
customer could cost almost 7 times more than retaining 
an existing customer. Customer churn can prove to be a 
roadblock for an exponentially growing organization and 
a retention strategy should be decided in order to avoid 
an increase in customer churn rates.

                The ability to be able to predict that a certain customer 
is at a very high risk of churning, while there is still 
some time to do something significant about it, itself 
represents a great additional potential revenue source 
for any business. Since the customer is the major source 
of profit, a method to promptly manage customer churn 
gains vital significance for the survival and development 
of any telecommunication company. For many telecoms 
companies, figuring out how to deal with churn is 
turning out to be the key for continued existence of their 
organizations.
In order to learn more about this issue and come up with a 
workable solution, research and implementations done in 
the past by other authors were examined. Churn studies 
are primarily focused on industries with contractual 
settings, such as telecommunications, banking, insurance, 
etc., where a consumer must sign a contract in order to 
use the service. As a result, the company labels a customer 
who cancels their contract as a churner, as opposed to a 
customer who keeps using the company’s services and is 
recognized as a non-churner.
The dataset for this research is based on the telecom 
statistics gathered from the Francisco gallery of bigml.
com will be the dataset we use for the majority of our 
discussion in this paper. This consists of 3333 examples 
and 20 qualities, along with a final categorization of either 
”Churned” or ”Not Churned” for each client, is based 
on telecom facts acquired from bigml.com's Francisco gallery. There are 483 churns and 2,850 non churn 
customers in the dataset. This dataset is also used to 
predict the customer’s behavior. It gives basic information 
about the customers service usage as well as information 
on their membership, both of which are useful for 
training the base model. Each record is described by the 
following attributes i.e. churn as class label, area, service 
calls, evening calls, evening charge, minutes spend in the 
evening, day calls, day charge, minutes spend in day time, 
international calls, international charge, minutes spend in 
international calls and finally it includes night calls, night 
charge, minutes spend in nights. The dataset is divided 
into training set and test set. The deep neural network is 
trained on the training data and tested on the test data.

                <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
                <p id="references"><br>
                   Previous works on churn prediction focused on predicting 
churn monthly based on static or monthly dynamic 
behavior. Two main drawbacks can be drawn from these 
works;
1. Predicting churn monthly is late for customers who 
decided to leave at the beginning of the last month 
because the customer will be identified as churners 
by the monthly model at the next month.
2. Considering the monthly behavior 
ignores the changes in customer’s 
behavior over days of the month and this may reduce 
the discriminative ability of the prediction model, and 
thus, its predictive performance.

            <h2>About</h2>
                <p id="about"><br>
                   In this study, we attempt to forecast daily levels of 
customer churn using dynamic shifts in daily activity. As 
a solution, we used a multivariate time series to represent 
the customer’s daily behavior and addressed the problem 
of daily churn prediction using this representation.
Meaningful features from timeseries data are extracted 
and then fed to a traditional machine learning model, 
such as Random Forest, to make predictions. Deep 
Learning models like LSTM and its Variants, which include 
classic LSTM, stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, and GRU, 
will learn the representative features from the multivariate 
time series and simultaneously predict churn.
The practical implementation of this study is suggested by 
our findings, which show that the deep learning models 
we suggest are operationally effective and forecast 
churners earlier and more precisely than the machine 
learning models and monthly models.
