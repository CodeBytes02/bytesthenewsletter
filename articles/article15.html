                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Satellite image time series, Large-scale control of 
agricultural parcels is a problem that is extremely 
important from both a political and economic standpoint. 
In this regard, automated classification of satellite image 
time series using hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural 
architectures has shown promising results. We suggest an 
alternate method that takes advantage of the convolutional 
layers being replaced with encoders that work with 
arbitrary sets of pixels to take advantage of the normally 
low resolution of openly accessible satellite photos.It is a 
collection of time- and space-varying satellite photos of 
the same location. A SITS utilises various satellite sources 
to produce a larger data set with close space between 
images. The resolution and registration restrictions must 
be respected in this scenario.
            </p><br>
               <p> It is possible to recognize how the Earth is changing, 
to identify the factors causing these changes, and to 
forecast future changes by using satellite measurements. 
The combination of data from ecosystem models and 
remotely sensed data presents a chance to forecast and 
comprehend the behaviour of the Ecosphere. It is easier 
to observe accurate spatio-temporal structures in range 
images with sensors that have high temporal and spatial 
resolutions. Spectral and spatial dimensions along with 
temporal elements enable the detection of complex.
For automated crop categorization, practitioners primarily 
use classic techniques like Randomized Rainforest (RF) 
and Svms (SVM), which work on handcrafted features. 
Convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural 
networks, two deep learning techniques recently used for 
acquiring spatial and temporal features have significantly 
improved classification performance. For the purpose 
of classifying crops, hybrid neural architectures that 
combine convolutions and repeating units into a single 
architecture are the most advanced at this moment.
The distribution of spectra so over parcels’ full spatial 
extent can be easily separated using set-based encoders.
