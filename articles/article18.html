                <h4>Tharun Vambaravelli Pursuing his master’s in the stream of Computer science and Engineering at International Institute of Information
Technology,Hyderabad. <br>Email: <a href="tharunvambaravelli@gmail.com">tharunvambaravelli@gmail.com</a></h4>
                <h2>Languages and Fundamentals</h2><br>
                Firstly choose a language and understand the basic 
fundamentals concepts such as variable declaration, basic 
syntax, data type and structures,flow control structures 
(conditions and loops), functional programming, 
recursion, object-oriented programming. Preferably, 
choose an object oriented language. 
            </p><br>
            <p id="tands">
                <h2>Time and Space Complexity</h2><br>
                For a problem, there can be more than one solution. You 
need to come up with an optimal solution for a problem. 
If you come up with multiple solutions for a problem, how 
do you choose the optimal one? Here comes the concept 
of time and space complexity. It is really important to learn 
these concepts and given a solution you must be able to 
analyze the time and space complexity.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <h2>Data Structures</h2>
                <p id="ds"><br>
                    Understanding data structures is integral to participating 
in competitive programming, as you will be faced with 
making decisions on what data structure to utilize to 
most efficiently solve the problem you are given. Some 
important Data structures are: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, 
Linked List, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Graphs, Tries, 
Hash tables, Heap. Some of the advanced data structures 
such as : Disjoint sets, Fibonacci Heap, Segment tree, 
Fenwick tree, B tree, B + tree, Self balancing binary tree 
(RB, AVL). 
Learning data structures alone is not sufficient but also 
trying to implement these data structures in your chosen 
language will be useful for better understanding. Try to 
understand and analyze the time and space complexities 
of the operations performed on each data structure. This 
will help you in choosing an appropriate data structure for 
solving a given coding problem.
                </p>
            </p><br>
            <p>
                <h2>Algorithms</h2><br>
                <p id="algo">
                    Algorithms are used to find the best possible way of 
solving a problem. Why to reinvent a wheel ? Algorithms 
can make life easier for developers by arming them with 
a range of general problem solving techniques. Choosing 
the standard algorithm is equally important as choosing 
an appropriate data structure for solving a problem. 
Some of the standard algorithms are: Searching & Sorting 
,Greedy algorithms ,Dynamic Programming, Pattern 
Searching, Recursive and Backtracking algorithms, 
Geometric Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Bit Algorithms, 
Number theory algorithms. Try to understand and analyze 
the time and space complexities for each algorithm. Give 
an attempt to implement each algorithm you have learnt 
in the chosen language.
                </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p id="debug"><br>
                    One common mistake a beginner makes is not using the 
debuggers. Try to use the debugger to debug the code 
and find out errors where you have made the mistake.
                </p>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Practice</h2>
            <p id="practice"><br>
                    Try to solve at least 200 questions on any of the platforms 
like LeetCode, HackerRank, GeeksForGeeks, CodeChef, 
CodeForces etc. Try to stick to one or two coding platforms 
in the beginning phase until you are confident enough in 
solving questions and get into the habit of coding. Stick to 
learn topic wise (data structure and algorithms) in the early 
days of coding. Try to pick a data structure,understand and 
implement it , and solve problems on this chosen data 
structure. In a race of solving the problems, don’t forget 
to build actually needed thought processes. It is more of 
quality rather than quantity while solving the problems. It 
is more important to solve problems from different topics.Try to be consistent in solving problems i.e. try to solve at 
least 2 problems per day. Don’t directly jump into solving 
the hard problems first as it may affect your confidence. 
Build confidence by first solving the easy problems,then 
medium and then hard problems.
                </p>
            </p><br>
            <h2>Giving Contests and Competitions</h2>
            <p id="gcc"><br>
                    After you think that you have got confidence in solving 
the problems, try to give contests in leetcode/codechef/
codeforces… Don’t get demotivated if you can’t solve a 
problem in the contest. Once the contest is finished, go 
through the discussion forums and try to understand 
various approaches. Even if you are able to solve the 
problem,try to check the other approaches which may 
be useful for solving other problems. Once you have 
enough practice in coding and giving contests regularly, 
you are now able to participate in competitions. Compete 
in competitions like ACM - ICPC, Google Code Jam, 
Facebook Hacker Cup. Happy coding
                </p>
