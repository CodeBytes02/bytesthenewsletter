                <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
                Modern operating systems are notable for being open, 
allowing us to download data or run programmes from 
any Internet source, reputable or not, without hesitation. 
When we wish to use this data or codes and maintain the 
system safe at the same time, a paradox arises.
Even after decades of research and experience, this 
issue is still seen as a major obstacle. In order to lessen 
the security concerns brought on by this dubious data 
or programmes for open operating systems, this study 
provides a revolutionary dynamic defensive model 
(DDM). The elements enable DDM to provide complete, 
dynamic, and real-time security protection throughout 
the operating system’s entire life cycle.
            </p><br>
            <p id="Dynamic Defense Model">
                <h2>Dynamic Defense Model</h2><br>
                A high-level security defense abstraction with four 
essential parts is called the “Dynamic Defense Model”: 1. 
Marking labels dynamically, 2. Tracking labels dynamically, 
3. Modulating labels dynamically, 4. Run-time regulation.
First of all, we cannot completely trust them given all the 
questionable data and codes. As a result, we must give 
them a distinctive label to set them apart from reliable 
information or codes.
Second, when the OS is functioning, suspect and sensitive 
data are consumed and spread across the system, and 
suspect processes produce child processes. We need 
to monitor where this data flow, how much data was 
contaminated, and how these shady activities impact the 
system via dynamic label tracking.
Thirdly, the original label may not adequately describe the 
suspicious processes’ current security station after real-
time execution of the suspicious processes was seen. 
According to the suspect processes’ most recent activity,the label should be dynamically modified.
Last but not least, we shouldn’t let any data or programmes 
spread or operate freely in the system without any 
controls.
            </p><br>
<p id="Data Label Marking">
<h2>Data Label Marking</h2><br>
                DDM typically offers three different types of labels: risk, 
cap, and sens.
Risk label: As soon as they enter the system, we should 
identify all the suspect data and codes that originate from 
Internet sources with specific names so that we can 
distinguish them from the reliable data and codes.
Cap label: The cap label is intended to stand for the 
most fundamental or minimal capabilities (permissions or 
privileges) that the suspicious code should be granted in 
order to carry out its intended function.
Sens label: The sens label is designed to represent how 
important the sensitive data or resources are.
</p><br>
<p>
<h2>Label tracking</h2><br>
We define the high level rule of our label tracking as:
 For the risk label, this rule can be specified as: 
A ∼ B ⇒ B.risk = max(A.risk, B.risk)
Label tracking is the same for both risk and sens labels.
 For the cap_o label, this rule can be specified as: 
A ∼ B ⇒ B.cap_o = (A.cap_o U B.cap_o)
            </p><br>
<p id="Dynamic Label Modulating">
<h2>Dynamic Label Modulating</h2><br>
 DDM modifies the label in three different ways: 
automatically incrementally, automatically decrementally, 
and Evaluative modulation.
 The rule for automatic incremental modulation of the risk 
label can be described as: risk_new = risk_old + f (action_
ill)
Similarly, the rule for automatic incremental modulation 
of sens and cap_o label can be described as: sens_new = 
sens_old + f (action_sen)
cap_o_new = cap_o_old + f (action_sen)
The rule for evaluative modulation can be described as: 
label_new = f (actions)
</p><br>
<p id="Runtime Controlling">
<h2>Runtime Controlling</h2>
 We cannot let any data or codes to spread or operate 
at will in the system without any controls. To avoid any 
potential harm to the system or the loss of confidential 
information, we should stop harmful acts in accordance 
with security regulations.
The following are examples of high-level runtime 
regulating rules: For the risk label, this rule can be specified 
as: running is permitted ⇐⇒ risk < threshold_kill
According to this rule, a process can continue to run 
if and only if the value of its risk label is lower than the 
process-killing threshold. For the risk label and sens label,
 this rule can be specified as: access is permitted ⇐⇒ risk + 
sens < threshold_sys
According to this rule, a process with a risk label can only 
access resources or sensitive data if the sum of the risk 
and sens values is below the system threshold. For the 
cap_s and the cap_o label, this rule can be specified as: 
access is permitted ⇐⇒ cap_o ⊆ cap_s
According to this rule, a process with the label cap s can 
only access resources or sensitive data with the label 
cap_o if and only if cap_o’s value is a subset of cap_s.

<h2>conclusion</h2>
When we wish to employ dubious data or code from 
an Internet source that we can’t completely trust while 
maintaining the operating system’s security, it might 
be quite difficult. A unique dynamic defensive model 
is presented by the author as a solution to this issue, 
reducing the security threats posed by suspicious data or 
codes.
